## Description
The Car Price Prediction project involves building a predictive model to estimate the price of a car based on various features such as make, model, year, mileage, and more.

## Installation
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/car-price-prediction.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd car-price-prediction
    ```
3. Create a new environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    ```
4. Activate the environment:
    - On Windows:
        ```bash
        .\env\Scripts\activate
        ```
    - On macOS and Linux:
        ```bash
